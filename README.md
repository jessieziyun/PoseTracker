# Skateboard

This code shows user keypoints as spheres and allows two users to participate at any one time.

### To do:

* ~~figure out socket.io, express and my server/client side setup~~
* ~~test sockets by displaying multiple users' poses in different colours~~
* ~~make a loading/information page~~

### Next iterations:
* 'blow' bubbles on detection of speech/sound (mouth tracking, audio detection)
* move bubbles with hands (hand tracking/edge detection?)
* store audio in bubbles
